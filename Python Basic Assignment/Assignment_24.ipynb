    "2. Function arguments: Choose descriptive names for the function arguments. Try to limit the number of arguments to a reasonable amount. \n",

    "3. Function documentation: Add a docstring at the beginning of the function that describes what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function structure: Break the function down into smaller, more manageable parts, using helper functions where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Function efficiency: Write functions that are efficient and optimized for speed and memory usage. Use built-in functions and libraries where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Error handling: Include appropriate error handling in your function to ensure that it can handle unexpected input and return helpful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Testability: Write functions that are easily testable. Consider writing unit tests for your functions to ensure that they work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Modularity: Write functions that can be easily reused in other parts of your code. Keep the function small and focused on a single task."

    "3. Side effects: Functions can have side effects that change the state of objects or variables outside of the function. \n",
