    "- The `yield` statement is used in Python generator functions to produce a sequence of values. When a generator function is called, it doesn't actually execute the function, instead, it returns an iterator object. The `yield` statement inside the generator function is used to produce a value to be returned to the caller of the iterator, and to \"pause\" the execution of the generator function until the next value is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every time the `yield` statement is encountered in the generator function, it produces a value that is returned to the caller. When the caller requests the next value from the iterator (by calling the `next()` function on the iterator object), the generator function resumes from where it left off and continues executing until it hits another `yield` statement, and the process repeats until there are no more values to produce.\n",
