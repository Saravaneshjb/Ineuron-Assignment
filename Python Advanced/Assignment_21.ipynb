    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random experiment or process. It provides a way to model and analyze uncertain or random phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the specific values or outcomes of a random process may be unpredictable, the probability distribution provides information about the likelihood or probability associated with each possible outcome. It describes the overall pattern or behavior of the random variable, including the probabilities of different values occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using probability distributions, we can make predictions and inferences about the likelihood of certain events or outcomes based on their probabilities. While we cannot predict individual outcomes with certainty, probability distributions allow us to understand the overall behavior and make statistical inferences about the population from which the random variable is drawn. Probability theory provides a framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty, allowing us to make informed decisions and draw conclusions based on probabilistic reasoning."

    "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "True random numbers are generated from physical processes that are inherently unpredictable, such as radioactive decay or atmospheric noise. These processes produce outcomes that cannot be determined or replicated precisely, resulting in truly random numbers. Examples of true random number sources include random physical phenomena, such as coin flips or dice rolls, or specialized hardware devices that capture random environmental noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms. They are not truly random, as their generation is based on a predefined mathematical formula or algorithm. However, they are designed to exhibit properties similar to those of random numbers. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use an initial value called a seed to start the algorithm and generate a sequence of numbers that, while not truly random, appear random for most practical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they exhibit properties such as uniformity, independence, and unpredictability over a large sequence of numbers. They pass various statistical tests and have a long period before repeating a sequence. PRNGs are computationally efficient, readily available, and can be used in simulations, modeling, cryptography, and various other applications where true randomness is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that pseudo-random numbers are deterministic and can be replicated if the algorithm and seed are known. They are not suitable for applications where high-security or genuine randomness is crucial, such as encryption key generation or gambling systems. In such cases, true random numbers from physical processes or specialized hardware sources are preferred."

In a normal distribution, the mean is located at the peak or center of the curve. Shifting the mean to the left or right will shift the entire distribution along the x-axis.\n",

    "2. Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. It indicates the average distance of data points from the mean. A larger standard deviation corresponds to a wider spread, while a smaller standard deviation corresponds to a narrower distribution. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n",

The majority of individuals would have heights close to the mean, and fewer individuals would have heights further away from the mean.\n",

The distribution of outcomes becomes more stable and consistent. This means that the relative frequencies of different outcomes approach the theoretical probabilities, and the average of the outcomes approaches the expected value.\n",

    "For example, if you repeatedly flip a fair coin, in the short term, you may observe a streak of heads or tails. However, as the number of coin flips increases, the proportion of heads and tails will tend to converge towards 0.5 each, reflecting the equal probability of heads and tails for a fair coin.\n",

For example, in the expression `a^b`, where `a` is the base and `b` is the exponent, exponentiation calculates the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`. The result is the product of multiplying `a` by itself `b` times.\n",

    "1. If `a^b = c`, then `log_a(c) = b`. The exponentiation operation (`a^b`) yields the value `c`, and the logarithm operation (`log_a(c)`) determines the exponent (`b`) needed to obtain `c` when `a` is raised to that exponent.\n",
