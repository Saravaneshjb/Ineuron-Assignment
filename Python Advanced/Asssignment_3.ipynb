    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that is used only as a base for other classes, and is not meant to be instantiated directly. It is often used as a template or blueprint for other classes, providing common functionality or attributes that can be inherited by its subclasses. An abstract superclass can define abstract methods or attributes that must be implemented by its subclasses, but it cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a way to organize related classes and enforce a common interface or behavior among them."
