    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, resulting in a more complex and versatile class hierarchy. In multiple inheritance, the subclass will inherit all the attributes and methods of its parent classes, and it can also define its own attributes and methods."

    "- Delegation is a programming technique in which an object passes responsibility for a task to another object. It is a way of reusing code by combining the functionality of multiple objects to achieve a common goal. In delegation, an object delegates a task to another object, which is responsible for performing that task. \n",

    "- In Python, delegation is implemented using composition, which involves creating objects of other classes as members of a class and delegating tasks to those objects. The class that contains the objects is called the delegator, and the objects that perform the tasks are called the delegates. The delegator object doesn't perform the task itself but delegates it to one of the delegate objects based on the situation. \n",

    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to avoid naming conflicts between attributes in a class and attributes in a subclass. When a class attribute name is prefixed with two underscores (e.g., `__attribute`), Python mangles the name to `_classname__attribute` to make it harder to access from outside the class. This makes it easier to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses, since the subclass's attribute names will be mangled differently.\n",

    "Pseudoprivate attributes are generally used as a way to signal to other developers that an attribute is not intended to be accessed from outside the class, but they are not enforced by the Python interpreter. It is still possible to access pseudoprivate attributes from outside the class by using the mangled name, although this is generally considered bad practice."
