    "- Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows programmers to create reusable and modular code by defining classes, which are essentially blueprints for creating objects. OOP provides a way to structure code by organizing data and methods that work with that data into a cohesive unit. This helps in reducing code redundancy, making code more manageable, easier to understand, and easier to maintain. \n",

It also facilitates code reuse by allowing developers to inherit properties and methods from existing classes and customize them for their specific use cases. \n",

    "In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an instance of a class, the search for the attribute first looks in the instance's own dictionary. If the attribute is not found there, the search moves to the class dictionary. If the attribute is still not found there, the search continues up the inheritance chain to the class's parent classes and their parent classes, until the attribute is found or the search reaches the top of the inheritance hierarchy (i.e., the base class `object`). If the attribute is not found anywhere along the inheritance chain, then an `AttributeError` is raised. This process is known as the \"method resolution order\" (MRO)."
