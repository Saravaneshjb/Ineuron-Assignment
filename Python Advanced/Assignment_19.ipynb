    "1. Attributes: These are the data or variables that describe the state of the objects created from the class. They represent the characteristics or properties associated with the objects. For example, a \"Person\" class may have attributes like name, age, and address.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming, a method is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with instances (objects) of that class. It defines the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between a method and a regular function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Associated with a class: A method is defined within a class and is associated with instances of that class. It operates on the data (attributes) of the class or performs actions related to the class. In contrast, a regular function is independent and does not have an inherent association with a specific class or its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accessing object data: Methods have access to the instance data (attributes) of the class through the use of the `self` parameter. They can read and modify the attributes of the object on which the method is called. Regular functions, on the other hand, do not have access to object-specific data unless passed as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Object-oriented paradigm: Methods are a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and play a crucial role in modeling real-world entities and their behavior. They enable encapsulation of data and functionality within objects and support concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Regular functions, on the other hand, are not bound by the OOP paradigm and can be used in any programming paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Method invocation: Methods are invoked using the dot notation on an instance of the class. The object on which the method is called becomes the implicit first argument (`self`). Regular functions are called by using their name followed by parentheses, without any implicit first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Class-specific behavior: Methods can have different implementations in different classes. Each class can define its own set of methods, allowing objects of different classes to exhibit different behaviors. Regular functions, on the other hand, are not bound to any specific class and have a fixed implementation that is reusable across different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a method is a function that is associated with a class and operates on instances of that class. It has access to object-specific data and supports the object-oriented paradigm. Regular functions, in contrast, are not tied to any specific class and can be used in a more general context."
