These two methods work together to implement the iteration protocol in Python classes."

By overloading operators, instances of the class can be manipulated in a way that is intuitive and familiar to users of the language. Operator overloading can also make code more concise and readable. However, it is important to use operator overloading judiciously and only when it enhances the clarity and readability of the code. Overloading operators excessively or inappropriately can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain."
